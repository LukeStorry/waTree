# waTree-backend 
A [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)-[Express](https://expressjs.com/) server that links a set of water-bottle-arduinos to a forest frontend.

Hosted on [Heroku](http://watree-backend.herokuapp.com/) and using [NoDB](https://github.com/Miserlou/NoDB) to store user info and lists of timestamps of water-drinking.

---

## API
For ease of use and testing during the experimentation, all API methods are HTTP GET.

### `/`
Returns a JSON list object with format `{Bottle:int, UserName:string, Score:int, isRaining:bool}` for each user.

### `/has-drunk/<bottleNum>`
Registers that a bottle has been drunk from, thus adding a timestamp to that bottle's associated `drinks` list.

### `/add/<name>`
Adds a new user to the database, with an empty drinks list and the lowest unused bottle number.

### `/rename/<bottleNum>/<name>`
Updates the user information associated with a particular bottle.

### `/reset/<name1>,<name2>,<name3>`
Removes all users from the database, and replaces them with a series of blank users with names given as csv.
