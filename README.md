## Components

### Bottle
Arduino code that registers a tilt on the accelerometer and calls the backend API to register that a particular bottle has been drunk from.

### Backend
An API based on a series of HTTP GET calls, to both register drinks and create a JSON for the output, as well as a series of database-updating and -resetting calls for user info.

### Frontend
A dynamically-scaling forest that uses the backend-supplied JSON to decide on tree size, names and animations.
